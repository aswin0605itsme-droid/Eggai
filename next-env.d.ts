// FIX: Commented out references to 'next' types to resolve "Cannot find type definition file" errors.
// This is a workaround for an environment where Next.js dependencies are not installed.
// The correct solution is to run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
// /// <reference types="next" />
// /// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript for more information.
